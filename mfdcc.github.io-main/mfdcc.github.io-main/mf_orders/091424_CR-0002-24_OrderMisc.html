                The Court, on its own account, finding that the defendant's rights can potentially be violated with the progress in which the proceedings are in,
                and that in which there is no timely response being made on the Court's concerns, and further that it is deemed to be in the interests of justice for
                the defendant to be afforded more time for the purposes of scheduling a preliminary hearing,
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>IT IS ORDERED</b> that Mayfl. D. Ct. 3(6) be waived in order to protect the defendant's rights.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED</b> that as a consequence of the waiver, the pre-trial duration be extended from 10 to 13 days <i>sua sponte</i> The new deadline is September 17, 2024.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED</b> that the State either agree to the Court's asynchronous preliminary hearing proposal or propose an alternative method on the channel no later than September 16, 2024.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED</b> that the State, as it proposed and was agreed for it to make an oral response to the defendant's motion to dismiss, make a response by no later than September 17, 2024, and the deadline for motions be waived retroactive owing to the Court's fault
                in its inaction.
