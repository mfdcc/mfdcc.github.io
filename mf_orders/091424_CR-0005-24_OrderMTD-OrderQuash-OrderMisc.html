                </u>
            </h3>

            <p class="order_bodytext">
                Comes now defendants TrexeoDev and GurkaCreed, by and through their counsel, filed a motion to quash
                and a motion to dismiss which are now pending in this court. The first and second motions were filed
                immediately after the authorization and issue of arrest warrants against him and 44 other defendants
                in the pending matter above on September 8, 2024. The government (hereinafter referred to as the "State")
                failed to respond to both motions on the deadline of September 10, 2024, in accordance with Mayfl. D. Ct. 3(9).
                This memorandum opinion and order is made in response to all outstanding actions from both parties which now have
                been settled. Further orders are made as to the sever requested by the State.
            </p>

            <b>I. Nature of the Case and Subsequent Proceedings</b>
            
            <p class="order_bodytext">
                This case involves the State's prioritized and vested interest in pursuing a criminal prosecution against 46 defendants,
                all of whom are allegedly indirectly or directly involved with an organization known as the "Mayflower Red Front" (hereinafter "Red Front").
                The State felt a critical moment to apply for a warrant against these 46 defendants, and applied to this court for an arrest warrant issued in full
                expedience and without delay. An oral hearing was requested and held accordingly for the arrest warrant <i>ex parte</i>, and the State was called to
                present their submissions for probable cause in support of a warrant. <i>Constitution of the State of Mayflower, Art. I., Sec. 8; U.S. Constitution, Amend. IV.</i>
                The court found probable cause upon the submission of two pieces of evidence -- namely a screen capture of the Red Front members in a Discord server identified to be
                a hub for activities related to the Red Front, and a clip of some of its members engaging in an execution of a government personnel. Additional information was given
                to the court, where the State gave the account of a government employee receiving a threat through the Attorney General's Office contact links. The court found further
                through a clip ofsome of the defendants engaging in the harm and execution of Mr. Burns961, Director of Mayflower's Public Broadcasting Service. Soon after, the courthouse 
                was <i>allegedly</i> attacked after the court announced its finding of probable cause for the warrant. A positive confirmation was made of someone in a Red Front uniform attacking
                the courthouse and this was relayed to the judge, with observers at these proceedings supporting the account as witnesses of the attack. There is no doubt as to the findings for the warrant
                being correct.
            </p>

            <p class="order_bodytext">
                The defendants (which is in reference to GurkaCreed and TrexeoDev only and are hereinafter known as the "movants"), upon receipt of news regarding the warrant, filed three motions: one Motion to Quash,
                Motion to Suppress and Motion to Dismiss by and through their attorney brotheman1. The movants eventually dropped the Motion to Suppress, and the court was left with only two Motions to answer. The State did not respond to these
                within the deadline. 
            </p>

            <b>II. The Motion to Quash</b>

            <p class="order_bodytext">
                Movants formally requested to the court that it reconsider the warrant made on September 8, 2024, and to declare it null and void by order.
                Movants asserts three grounds: firstly, that the warrant was issued in violation of the movant's first amendment right to counsel. <i>Id., at Art. I, Sec. 5;</i> secondly, that the warrant was issued in violation of the
                movant's first amendment rights to due process. <i>Id.;</i> thirdly, that because of the first and second ground, the warrant should be quashed in the interests of justice.
            </p>

            <p class="order_bodytext">
                In support of their first ground, movants believe that this stage--the ex parte warrant hearing--is a part of or is a preliminary hearing for the purposes of holding and opinion in <i>Coleman</i>, and thus a "critical stage" of
                criminal proceedings, which entitles movants to representation by counsel. <i>See Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1 (1970).</i> The fact that the movants were not included or not made aware about this hearing deprived them of their
                first amendment rights.
             </p>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                In the second ground, movants believe that under <i>Elridge</i>, they were supposed to be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the warrant was authorized and issued by the court. <i>See Mathews. v. Elridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976).</i>
                This is a consequence of the first ground movants raised, and because of this notice not being given, they were deprived of the opportunity to challenge the basis for the warrant.
             </p>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                In the third and final ground, movants' asserts that the first two grounds form sufficient basis to quash the warrant, and that this should be done in the interest of justice.
             </p>

             <b>III. The Motion to Dismiss</b>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                Movants stipulate that the information, in its current form, is not consistent with Mayfl. R. Crim. P. 3(3)(4) nor with Mayfl. R. Crim. P. 3(3). They assert that overall, it is a violation of the movants' rights to due process of law.
             </p>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                In support of this point, movants assert that the information fails to be a sufficient charge against them. Namely, the timeline in which the information relies on is too broad that it is materially difficult for the movants' to form a plausible
                defense to the charges, and is inconsistent with <i>Cruikshank.</i> <i>See United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1875).</i> They also assert that it is inconsistent with standards re-iterated in <i>Hamling.</i> 
                <i>See Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974); Hagner v. United States, 285 U.S. 427 (1932); United States v. Debrow, 346 U.S. 374 (1953).</i> The particulars stated for each charge alleged in
                the information is a mere regurgitation of the text of the statute, and does not provide specific facts in aid of movants' defence. <i>See Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749 (1962).</i>
             </p>

             <b>IV. Reasons for the Motion to Quash</b>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                The movants argued that the proceedings of this ex parte hearing on the warrant is, to this court's understanding, a preliminary hearing for the purposes of the <i>Coleman</i> decision. Where the ex parte hearing was, for that purpose, a preliminary hearing,
                then it is trivial that movants would be entitled to counsel. This is a focal misunderstanding in movants' position. The Supreme Court addresses this point very closely in a separate case involving an Alabama court. It distinguished the difference between a
                preliminary hearing from the fourth amendment probable cause determination -- which is what this is. The Alabama law at the time held preliminary hearings to determine whether sufficient evidence existed to charge someone with an offense and thus go to trial --
                this is what is commonly known to us as the preliminary hearing to be held just before trial (usually on information). <i>Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 122 (1975).</i> Such a hearing would weigh in the evidence and have substantial effect on the case, e.g. a suspect being
                released from the alleged complaints against him on a finding of no probable cause. <i>Id., at 123.</i> The difference between this and the fourth amendment probable cause issue is that it only concerns pretrial custody, which does not have substantial effect as the case identified
                in <i>Coleman</i> and <i>Wade</i>. <i>Id.; Coleman, supra.; United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967).</i> <i>Coleman</i> discusses that because there is substantial effect from the outcome of a preliminary hearing, adversary safeguards are necessary for them, but
                "not essential for the probable cause determination required by the Fourth Amendment", as the "issue can be determined reliably without an adversary hearing," when "the sole issue is whether there is probable cause for detaining the arrested person pending further proceedings",
                i.e. in the context of the standard used for arrests (which police officers regularly utilize). <i>Gerstein, supra., at 120.</i> Thisis what actually happened in this case so far, and the hearing held for the warrant was solely to make that fourth amendment probable cause determination, nothing else.
                The standards used for that "are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life of which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians act," and thus the "standard of proof is accordingly correlative to what must be proved."
                <i>Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175 (1949).</i> This should not be in dispute, and the considerations are simple enough that even lay people can make sound conclusions.
             </p>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                To make such determinations on warrant requests, it is common for courts to handle them in a non-adversarial proceeding; no confrontation exists between the state and the defendants and no expectation for confrontation would presently exist.
                Such proceedings "traditionally have been decided by a magistrate [...] on hearsay and written testimony, and the [Supreme] Court has approved these informal modes of proof." <i>Gerstein, supra.</i> 
             </p>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                Additionally, it is also considered an informal procedure, which "does not require the fine resolution of conflicting evidence that a reasonable doubt or even a preponderance standard demands, and credibility determinations are seldom crucial in deciding whether the evidence supports a reasonable belief in guilt."
                <i>Id., at 121.</i> Because the fourth amendment probable cause determination in question does not bring a substantial effect against or for anyone that would require adversarial protections, and that a simple determination is sufficient, it is not a
                "critical stage in the prosecution that would require appointed counsel," where a critical stage in this context is a "pretrial procedure[s] that would impair defense on the merits of the accused is required to proceed without counsel." <i>Id., at 122.</i> No such impairment would occur from a simple determination on an arrest warrant,
                for it can be challenged after the fact in another, valid way. As it is particularly difficult to have the warrant in question to be quashed in this manner, it is usually common for those in movants' position to consider a <i>Franks</i> motion, which gives basis for movants' to challenge the warrant and have it invalidated
                on the basis of the statements used to support the affidavit for the warrantbeing false, among other reasons movants' can raise and show, on preponderance of the evidence. This would be a more appropriate approach.
             </p>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                The <i>Elridge</i> issue is consequently misapplied. Importantly, <i>Elridge</i> concerned an evidentiary hearing (which I made clear earlier and remind again that this is not),and when in reference to the "sufficient notice" point movants raised, I understood that movants werein reference to a quote in
                <i>Joint Anti-Fascist Comm v. McGrath,</i> in which the Supreme Court stated that "a person in jeopardy of serious loss [be given] notice of the case against him and opportunity to meet it" for proceedings subject to due process. <i>Mathews, supra., at 348; See Joint Anti-Fascist Comm v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 171-172 (1951).</i>
                Where notice was given in such a situation, it would defeat the purpose of a timely or sensitive arrest warrant, and potentially hamper the State's interest to pursue dangerous suspects whom if such notice was given upon service or otherwise, would either be ineffective against the defendants or the State may suffer incredible loss of
                potential evidence, and likely undermine the State's case before it even makes it in the docket. Additionally, there was no likelihood that movants faced any serious loss, as it could challenge the warrant after the fact. It was unlikely movants would be successful in claiming their entitlement to such notice.
             </p>

             <b>V. Reasons for the Motion to Dismiss</b>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                It is not possible to consider this motion at this stage as the case has not be formally filed to the court. To clear up any confusion, it is on the docket purely for the purpose of organizing the warrant. A case should not have considered to be filed and started without an affidavit in support of the complaint being attached,
                which I and the movants' recognize is not the case. There are valid issues raised in the Motion to Dismiss, but would send this back to the movants' to reconsider filing a motion pursuant to Mayfl. R. Crim. P. 7(2) if permitted.
                Where the State declares the case filed <b>on the record</b>, this motion or the Rule 7(2) motion would be considered by the court. I found reason to respond as I believe I owe counsellors a response.
             </p>

             <b>VI. Conclusion and Order</b>

             <p class="order_bodytext">
                Movants' grounds do not have merit in its Motion to Quash, and the Motion to Dismiss is not appropriate to be considered at this stage. Movant's Motion to Quash is therefore <b>DENIED</b>. The warrant is not quashed for the reasons stated and remains active until full, completed service and execution.
                Movant's Motion to Dismiss is <b>DENIED</b> and the case remains pending COMPLETE FILING. Movants' are welcome to refile a motion to dismiss if appropriate, or on another motion suggested in this MO&O. I further <b>ORDER</b> that the case be severed in accordance withthe arrangement acceptable with the court,
                on grounds of preventing the breach of defendants' constitutional rights. I will consider that some of the severed cases are assigned to a different judge, owing to docket overload.
