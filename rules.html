            Failing to do so may result in a contempt of court charge levied against the perpetrator at the judge's own motion (if it is lawful):

            <i>N.B. of the following:</i>
            <p>
                Breaking the rules may result in me removing you from the courtroom or channel, or potentially remove you from participating in the case indefinitely (if permitted by law). In such a case
                your lawyer should continue to liaise and communicate with you about the case unless they withdraw for good reason.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you break these rules as a lawyer, you may be reprimanded to the State Bar in addition to any of the penalties above.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your actions are so egregious that it does not only break the rules but may lead to you breaking them again and you show no effort to prevent yourself from breaking them, you may be charged with contempt. You may also be charged with a criminal offense if a crime is committed as well while breaking these rules (such as rule 2).
            </p>

            <p>
                The venue for which these rules apply are not fixed. They apply to wherever the judge is expected to be present. At the moment, it can be:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lander Courthouse</li>
                    <li>Mersea Town Hall Courthouse</li>
                    <li>Any temporary Courthouse</li>
                    <li>Special courtrooms where the judge is invited to preside</li>
                    <li>Discord servers</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Anyone who breaks these rules may first be warned, up to three warns. After that, they may be found in contempt of court given it is appropriate to.</p>
            
            <p>These rules are not in contravention of local, state or UC laws and the State and UC constitution.</p>
