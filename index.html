                I am available for emergency actions. Urgent, time-sensitive enquiries should be made directly to my private messages.
                If the urgent request can be fulfilled by any other judge or magistrate, you should contact them first instead.

            <h3>FAQ</h3>

            <p>
                <b>
                    Q: How are cases assigned in this court?
                </b><br>
                A: Cases are assigned to a judge randomly by the clerk or myself. It is essential that cases are assigned this way to maintain impartiality among the judges.
                I use a specific mathematical formula to assign judges to cases.
                
                <br><br>

                <b>
                    Q: How do I begin action in the court?
                </b><br>
                A: You should first join the server I linked above then follow the instructions in there.
                For clarity, you would need to use /file [casetype] to begin filing. Use /filetype in bot-commands to find out
                what cases you can file.

                <br><br>

                <b>
                    Q: How do I become an attorney?
                </b><br>
                A: You must either receive a certificate confirming an Out-of-State Transfer of your Bar License to this state, or take the State Bar examination on its next scheduled date.
                You may need to undertake formal education and attain credits before sitting the State Bar. If you pass it successfully, you will be admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court (and you will automatically be entitled to the Bar of this Court as well).

                <br><br>

                <b>
                    Q: What emergency actions will you be available for?
                </b><br>
                A: I will be available for any urgent warrant requests; actions related to state, county, or local governments that are time-sensitive;
                and urgent interventions involving judges. In all other cases, you should attempt to contact another judge or magistrate.

                <br><br>

                <b>
                    Q: I need a lawyer, how do I get one?
                </b><br>
                A: Lawyers or firms of them frequently advertise their services in the main server's #advertisement channel. You can approach a lawyer or firm there who will assess your case and determine whether to take you on as a client.
                If you cannot afford one and you are being charged with a criminal offense, one will be assigned to you by the Public Defender's Office (you are entitled to this per Art 1, section 5 of the State Constitution); if you wish to represent yourself,
                you will be warned about the disadvantages and complications from this, but if you wish to proceed either way the court will likely grant this, if it is lawful (this is called <i>pro se</i> representation). In a civil action,
                you are not entitled to such services but you will be given information by the court on pro-bono or legal aid services.

                <br><br>

                <b>
                    Q: How do I refer certain cases?
                </b><br>
                A: Mayflower operates on a dual sovereignty system with the federal system being the U.S. federal system, but for our purposes we have renamed them as U.C. or Union of Columbia. 
                You are permitted to cite U.S. Supreme Court decisions. The state courts are bounded to them via the Supremacy Clause as well (<i>Ableman v. Booth</i>, 62 U.S. (21 How.) 506 (1859), among other decisions supporting this view). Certain other federal case law may be cited and they may take persuasive authority
                (see this guide <a href="https://www.law.uga.edu/sites/default/files/uploaded-files/Clutter%20WHICH_COURT_IS_BINDING_Painter-and-Mayer-FINAL.pdf">here</a>, it's quite useful).
                When citing federal case law, replace U.S. with U.C.. So for <i>Ableman</i>, it'd be <i>Ableman v. Booth</i>, 62 U.C. 506 (1859) in our documents. We will also interpret any current year to be in the year 2001 for lore purposes.
